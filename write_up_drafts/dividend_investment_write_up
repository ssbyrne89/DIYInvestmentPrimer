I got my tax return and third stimulus check, I'm feeling some FOMO investing but what do I do?

-What is investing?
Let me put it simply. Anything can be considered an investment. If you buy something and then the value of that thing increases to a price higher than what you paid for it then that was a good investment. The value appreciated and you could call that thing an asset.
Let me share a redneck example of an investment. I have an acquaintance who bought a bunch of guns while Trump was in office. Bear with me now… I know this is a crazy example but it illustrates how anything can be considered an investment. So this redneck acquaintance of mine bought these guns not to go hunting or to protect his property. He's more of a creative and forward thinking redneck because he figured Trump would not get re-elected and that democrats would win the presidency and senate.
So, what…
Well, he knew guns are cheap when republicans are in office and that guns get really expensive when democrats are in office. So he figured that buying a bunch of guns while Trump is in office and then resell them to a pawn shop at higher price while Biden is in office. Well, he was right. He paid $450 for one rifle and now he could resell it for $2000.
I know this is probably a horrible example to use, but it truly does illustrate that you can consider anything to be an investment, especially if you have some unique understanding of a particular item like my redneck acquaintance has. 
What is the stock market?
Let's consider a more conventional means of investment. Stocks.
What are stocks? They are a thing that gives you part ownership of a company. The stock market is the platform used to buy and sell these part ownerships. People buy stocks with the hopes that they will increase to a price higher than what they paid.
Stocks are a popular investment asset because they are relatively easy to manage especially in comparison to other types of investments like real estate properties or owning a business. However, tread carefully because stocks have their own risks as well, but those can be easily avoided or mitigated. The major risk to which I'm referring is volatility. Volatility is the possibility of the price of a stock to increase or decrease. It's virtually unavoidable, especially considering the pandemic and 'Wall Street bets.' Some people even love volatility because it can provide opportunity to make a lot of money. Let's just keep it simple for now, though.
Where do I start?
For those who have never invested the stock market can seem very overwhelming because there are thousands of companies whose stocks you can buy. Which one do you choose? Well first let me start by saying that you should never invest more money than you can afford to lose. For example, if you're just making $15/hour then maybe just invest $5 a month. Investing such small amounts but with trading platforms such as "Robin Hood" and "WeBull" that is now possible. 
Next, it's useful to know that stock investment provides the best results when you commit to playing the long game. That would mean promising yourself that you won't withdraw for at least 5 years. For people who don't like to save that can sound hard, but it is a good habit to develop and if you're just putting in $5 a month then that
