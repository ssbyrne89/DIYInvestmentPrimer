Prototyping our MVP locally

    ###Create the database table model -- S.B.

    ###Create a DOTENV file for environment variables to keep api keys guarded -- S.B.

    #Create a SQLite database for the initial prototyping  -- Pair Programming
    
    ###Migrate AlphaVantage API call function from Notebook to  the `database.py` file 
    with the rest of the app - Pair Programming

    Populate the table -- Pair Programming
       ###rewrite `parseDataFromAlphaVAPI()` to use two keys
       add something that will log the API calls per key
    
    rewrite `parse` and `populate` functions to commit to the DB every ten companies -- E.G.
    
    move the `populateDB()` to the if __name__ = "main"???
    
    Add the chron so that it automatically updates the database monthly

    ###Design the the graph/table for `best dividend growth companies on the S&P500`
        #Take photo of example graph drawing and put it into the repo for reference -- S.B.
        

    write the queries for to produce the `best dividend growth companies on the S&P500` -- E.G.

    Put into a pandas dataframe Plot the results of the above query --E.G. with some Pair Programming

    Embed the data visualization of the graph as Plotly embedding on the HTML template -- S.B.
