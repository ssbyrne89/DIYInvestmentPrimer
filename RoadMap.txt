Prototyping our MVP locally

    #Create the database table model -- S.B.

    Create a SQLite database for the initial prototyping  -- Pair Programming

    #Design the the graph/table for `best dividend growth companies on the S&P500`
        Take photo of example graph drawing and put it into the repo for reference -- S.B.
        

    write the queries for to produce the `best dividend growth companies on the S&P500` -- E.G.

    Put into a pandas dataframe Plot the results of the above query --E.G. with some Pair Programming

    Embed the data visualization of the graph as Plotly embedding on the HTML template -- S.B.
